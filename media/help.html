<h2>Descriptor Structural Alignment</h2><br/>

<a name="mode">Mode</a><br/>
<p></p><br/>

<a name="offset">Max. sequence offset</a><br/>
<p>Sequence offset is used to obtain sequence dependent comparisons. It is assumed that there exists a direct 1:1 correspondence between the sequences of the proteins, and only residues aligned with offset not greater than k will be counted. This mode is especially useful for comparing models of the same protein in structure prediction applications. If lengths of compared structures differ, offset is measured from the closest alignment with gaps only in the shorter sequence.</p><br/>

<a name="maxinv">Max. sequence swaps</a><br/>
<p>Maximal numbers of segment swaps allowed in computed alignment. -1 denotes infinity. During computation if processed alignment contains more swaps than the given limit, the largest subalignment containing the maximal number of swaps will be considered. E.g. value 1 means that only circular permutations and alignments without swaps will be returned.</p><br/>

<h2>Structure</h2><br/>

<a name="file">PDB  or ASTRAL code</a><br/>
<p>Code of a protein structure in PDB database or ASTRAL compendium. PDB codes are composed of 4 alphanumerical characters (e.g. 1m55), and can be followed by a letter denoting a chosen chain (e.g. 1m55A) (otherwise the whole molecule will be used in alignment). Codes of ASTRAL domains are 7 characters long, and begin with letter d (e.g. d1m55a_).<p><br/>

<a name="structfile">File</a><br/>
<p>A properly formatted  <b>all atom</b> PDB file should be uploaded. Coordinates of sidechain atoms are required to determine geometrical centers of residues which are used to compute inter-residue contacts. Multiple chains are accepted although submitting entire crystal cells with internal symmetries may significantly increase computation time, while giving multiple insignificant alignments.</p><br/>
